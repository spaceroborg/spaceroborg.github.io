                  I'm originally from India and moved to London in 2018 to pursue my studies at Imperial College London. I completed an MEng in Aerospace Engineering in 2022 and an MSc in Human and Biological Robotics in 2023, focusing on implementing bio-inspired aerial robotics to understand and interact with our environment. 
                  I'm fascinated by the natural world and how we can draw from it to solve complex engineering problems. My interests sit at the intersection of bio-inspired robotics and autonomous systems, especially in the context of drones and spacecraft. I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) — the brain behind every precise maneuver.
                  London has played a significant role in shaping both my personality and research interests. I enjoy meeting new people and exploring different cultures, and I'm always seeking opportunities to collaborate with diverse teams — not only to grow professionally and personally, but also to give back to the community and contribute meaningfully to society.
                  This website is both a professional and personal reflection of how I've developed over the years. It includes a list of open-source university, research, and independent projects that I've worked on and contributed to.
