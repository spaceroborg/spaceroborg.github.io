Ever since the AI-deck 1.x was released in early access, we’ve been excited to see so many users diving in and experimenting with it. The product is still in early access, where the hardware is deemed ready but the software and documentation still needs work. Even so, we try to do our best to make the product as usable as possible. We’re happy to see some of our users doing great stuff, like the pulp-platforms latest paper “Fully Onboard AI-powered Human-Drone Pose Estimation on Ultra-low Power Autonomous Flying Nano-UAVs“.

Firmware and Examples
---------------------

The AI-deck consists of the GAP8 chip developed by Greenwaves Technologies. On their website there’s an explanation of development tools where you get a general understanding of what you can use. Also their GAP SDK documentation explains how to install and try out some of their examples as well, on both a GAP8 simulator on the computer or on the GAP8 chip on the AI-deck itself.

We also host an separate repository for some AIdeck related examples which runs with the GAP SDK.

Documentation and Support
-------------------------

Recently we also added the AIdeck documentation to the Bitcraze website, generated from the docuemtnation already available in the Github repository. There’s still improvements to make, so if you find any issues or any additions needed, don’t hesitate to help us improve it. On the bottom there is an ‘improve this page’ link where you can give the suggested change, or notify us by posting on the issue list of the AIdeck repository.

Also note that we have a separate AI-deck category on our forum where you can search for or add any AI-deck related questions. Remember that posting the issues that you are having will also help us to improve the platform and hopefully soon get it out of Early Access.

Workshop by PULP-platform
-------------------------

On the 16th of April we hosted a workshop given by PULP-platform featuring Greenwaves Technologies. In the workshop the an overview of the AI-deck and GAP8 was given as well as going through some basic hands-on exercises. About 70 people joined the workshop and we were happy it was so well received.

The workshop is a great source of information for anybody who is just getting started with the AI-deck, so have a look at the recordings on Youtube and the slides on the event page. Also make sure to check out their PULP training page for more tools that also can be used on the AI-deck. A big thanks to the PULP-platform and Greenwaves Technologies for taking part in the workshop!

Also we would like to ask if anybody who joined the workshop, to fill in this small questionnaire so that we can get some more feedback on how it went and how we can improve for the next one.
