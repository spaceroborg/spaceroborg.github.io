        <h2>Projects & Research</h2>
        <p> Shared curiosity for the natural world offers a fertile foundation for interdisciplinary innovation. My university research focused on bio-inspired aerial robotics â€” exploring how nature can inform the design of intelligent machines to interact meaningfully with the environment.
          Here you'll find an overview of my completed projects, along with other contributions in the area of robotics, AI, and UAVs.</p>

          <h4>MEng Thesis - Optical Flow Guided Soft-Grasping Aerial Robot for Aquatic Waste Management</h4>
          <p>Designed and developed an autonomous aerial robot for collecting surface debris from water bodies. 
            The system used optical flow divergence for altitude control and smooth landings over water. </p>
