        <h2>Projects & Research</h2>
        <p> Shared curiosity for the natural world offers a fertile foundation for interdisciplinary innovation. My university research focused on bio-inspired aerial robotics — exploring how nature can inform the design of intelligent machines to interact meaningfully with the environment.
          Here you'll find an overview of my completed open-source projects, along with other contributions in the area of robotics and UAVs.</p>

          <h4>MEng Thesis - Optical Flow Guided Soft-Grasping Aerial Robot for Aquatic Waste Management</h4>
          <p>Designed and developed an autonomous aerial robot for collecting surface debris from water bodies. 
            The system used optical flow divergence for altitude control and smooth landings over water. </p>

          <h4>Industry Projects</h4>
          <p>I am working in industry on software development and controls for drones. All information is proprietary so I cannot share it on my website.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="project-item">
          <h4>Visual Navigation Software</h4>
          <p>Developing and maintaining a modular ROS2 workspace to serve as the backbone for drone communication and mission control. Also developing a pipeline that matches live drone images with satellite maps and custom geo-cutter tool that extracts a localized satellite patch based on the drone’s estimated coordinates. </p>
          <p>The project is for a company so it is closed-source.</p>
